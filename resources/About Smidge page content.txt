About Smidge


Black + White Photography is a passion of Photo Artist Smidge.


Photo Art


Smidge found he had to photograph almost everything he saw. And so he developed his passion for Photo Art and of telling the story of everyday sights in black and white digital images. 


Even the most mundane piece of fruit, a map, grafitti, or street furniture can be combined to tell a special story under Smidge's expert photography.
